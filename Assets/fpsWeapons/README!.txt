thank u for purchasing fps weapons!


in order to play the demo scene u need to copy paste the projectsettings folder provided in the asset folder and overwrite your default ones.
(on windows this is in your root asset folder in explorer)
or use the asset to build your own ;)

demoscene controls:

WASD to move
SPACE to jump
LEFT SHIFT to run
LEFT MOUSE to fire
RIGHT MOUSE to aim
F action
G grenadetoss
t meleeweapon
C crouch/uncrouch
r to reload
i inventoty(left/right inputs to switch and press i again or left mouse to select)
(or use a XBOX controller)

press jump to enter a ladder from the bottom, when entering a ladder from top this is not necessary.

if the GUI does not display correctly set the game aspect ratio to 16:9


note that the scripts and demoscene provided are for demonstration purpose ,
this is not intended to be a full FPS kit but should give u an idea on how to set the weapons up.




for questions mail to 3dmaesen@gmail.com

have fun!
